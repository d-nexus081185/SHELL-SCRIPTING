Project - Simple age predictor app (using shell scripts)

Description - Creating an Interactive simple age predictor app that would easily predict the age by prompting the user to input Year of birth.
	      With the information the value is compared with a variable holding the value of the current year, which if its less than or equal to
  	      (-le) comapared using an IF STATEMENT returns various echo prompts but most importanatly the age of the user.
	    
	      A mathematical expression is inserted in the code that calculates the age using simple maths; subtracting the input from the user from the current 
	      year and inputing the result in a variable which is called later in the code to prompt the age.

More Information:

Ths is a side project to help me assimilate more the concepts I am currently learning and also improve my programming skills which primarily includes debugging and resoucefulness.

Invitation:

Its an open project and I would be glad to have other people come in to bascially share ideas which can help me develop and learn better.
