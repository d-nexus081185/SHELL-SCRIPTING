Hi there,

Hope this finds you well.

I am on a journey to learn and apply the principles of software engineering.
I started learning shell scripts and other relevant concepts and decided to get my hands dirty.

I started working on this pet project, which is basically all about user authentication for dashboard access for a generatic app.

We aim to use this to further deepen our knowledge base on the use of shell scripts to create a logical program that touches all aspects on user input and authentication to grant access for;
1. Username input
2. Default password input, confirmation and change
3. Wrong password detection and error message generation, and so many more concepts that will be added in due time.

However, we also use this oppourtunity to seek input from other experienced software engineers or inexpereinced software engineers like me, so we can break and find a way to make it back to form part of out learning process.
